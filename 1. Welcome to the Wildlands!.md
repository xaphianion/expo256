## Hey, you - you’re finally awake

Not that getting any sleep in a wagon convoy was exactly a simple thing to do. With an efficient roster, and scheduled animal exchanges, it's clear that now, after 255 other expeditions, this has become a well-practiced routine. That doesn't make any of the mountainous terrain more comfortable to experience, but hey - at least it's not winter, right?

The pressure is on. Of the previous 255 expeditions, over the last 12 years, only 8 have managed to establish a permanent settlement. Some might call those bad odds - but for many of these expeditions, they were better odds than remaining at home. While your homelands can be industrious, they can also be treacherous to anyone who poses at threat to the status quo. Whether it be for opportunity, to escape, or just sheer boredom - there are a myriad of reasons why one might end up joining an expedition.

Not least of which is the chance to establish yourself as new nobles. The land you are sent to comes along with a charter granting you these lands. If you can survive long enough to establish a settlement, that settlement will be under your protection, and fiefdom. Word of a successful expedition ALWAYS brings people looking for a new life - for better, and for worse.

## Cregg's Outpost

Your destination is visible from afar, and the first sign of civilization you've seen in days. You're aware of a couple, Cregg and Tatiana, who have established a trading post in your very own Wildlands. A standard, preplanned outpost, and a traditional start for most expeditions, it will house you and your companions, as well as provide initial space for resources and animals. However, while your wagonneers begin the process of offloading your initial resources, you look around and see no one. From one of the buildings, however, you hear loud sobbing.

The large, weeping man you find must be Cregg, and from the constant wails and the way he is clutching a woman's shawl to his chest, it's hard for your mind not to be cast to the worst scenario. Cregg notices the group, and begins to hurry around his kitchen fixing chairs, mugs, and food, while apologizing for his demeanour.

"Only fer it good t'yer here'n now. We just'n have a visit off'er some nasty, nasty folk, and yer help'r be very much t'appreciated. See, yer not the first'a expedition ter come through these parts. One'a them from a'fore, he headed out into that there forest, un done took up with the natives, y'hear? Kobolds, goblinners, the like! He call'n himself a Lord of the Dark now, but'n we mostly call him 'Dark Lord'...and he took my Tatiana!"

Cregg loses himself in tears again, but after wiping his nose on whatever porous surfaces he can get his hands on, he chokes back the tears.

"Cos'n he knew you were comin'! So's he says, all of the booty, the loot, the building blockers, they need to be fer him! So'n he says, he'll come back in ONE MONTHs time, and'n we better give him everything, or'n he'll kill my Tatiana!"

With that, Cregg loses his composure again.
